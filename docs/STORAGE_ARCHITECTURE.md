# Storage Architecture

This document describes the local DuckDB storage foundation added under
`market_intelligence/storage/`. It covers infrastructure only — see
[PROJECT_STATE.md](../PROJECT_STATE.md) and [DATA_CATALOG.md](../DATA_CATALOG.md)
for what data has (and has not) actually been ingested.

## Scope

This foundation defines and applies exactly two tables:

- **`schema_migrations`** — tracks which versioned migrations have been
  applied, with a checksum of each migration file's content.
- **`ingestion_runs`** — records metadata about each attempted
  data-ingestion run (provider, dataset, timing, status, record count, and
  a sanitized error category). It does not store any provider data itself.

No market-bar, macroeconomic-observation, news, forecast, or trade tables
exist yet. Those each require a separate, reviewed data contract before
they are added as their own versioned migration.

## Components

- `market_intelligence/storage/database.py` — `DuckDBManager`, the
  migration runner, and the path-safety check.
- `market_intelligence/storage/migrations/*.sql` — versioned schema
  migrations, applied in ascending filename order.
- `scripts/initialize_database.py` — applies pending migrations to the
  configured local database; prints only the database path, schema
  version, and applied migration count.
- `scripts/check_database.py` — read-only health check; verifies the
  database file exists and the required tables are present without
  writing anything.

## Database location and path safety

The database file defaults to `<project_data_path>/market_intelligence.duckdb`,
where `project_data_path` comes from `Settings` (`market_intelligence/config/settings.py`)
and itself defaults to this repository's own `data/` directory. `*.duckdb`
files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

`DuckDBManager` resolves the target database path and refuses to
initialize (raising `DatabasePathSafetyError`) if it falls outside the
configured `project_data_path`. There is no bypass flag: to point the
manager at a different location (for example, an isolated directory in
tests), construct `Settings` with a different `project_data_path` — the
manager's default resolution then naturally lands inside it. This keeps
the enforced boundary and the configured boundary the same thing, so a
test's "explicitly injected" location is never a special case in the
safety check itself.

## Migration runner semantics

Migration files live in `market_intelligence/storage/migrations/` and
must be named `NNNN_description.sql`, where `NNNN` is a zero-padded
version. On `initialize()`:

1. Migration files are loaded, checksummed (SHA-256), and sorted by
   filename (equivalent to ascending version order). A malformed
   filename, a duplicate version, or a non-ascending sequence raises
   `MigrationError` before anything is executed.
2. Already-applied versions are read from `schema_migrations` (treated as
   empty if that table does not exist yet — true only for a brand-new
   database, since `schema_migrations` itself is migration `0001`).
3. For each migration not yet applied, its SQL and the corresponding
   `schema_migrations` bookkeeping row are executed inside a single
   `BEGIN TRANSACTION` / `COMMIT`. Any failure triggers a `ROLLBACK`,
   so the migration's DDL and its bookkeeping row either both persist or
   neither does. The runner then raises `MigrationError` — it does not
   attempt to continue past a failed migration.
4. For each migration already applied, its current file checksum is
   compared against the stored checksum. A mismatch raises
   `MigrationError` rather than silently re-applying or ignoring the
   change — a migration file must not change after it has been applied
   to any database.

Re-running `initialize()` against an up-to-date database applies zero
migrations and does not error (idempotent).

### Why `schema_migrations` is migration `0001`, not runner-side bootstrap DDL

`schema_migrations` is created by an ordinary versioned migration file
(`0001_create_schema_migrations.sql`) rather than hardcoded bootstrap SQL
in `database.py`. The runner only special-cases *reading* that table
before it may exist (treating "table not found" as "zero migrations
applied so far"); it does not special-case *creating* it. This keeps the
full schema — including its own bookkeeping table — defined in one place
(the migrations directory) and covered by the same checksum/ordering
guarantees as every other migration.

## Health check

`DuckDBManager.check_health()` opens the database read-only
(`duckdb.connect(path, read_only=True)`) and reports whether the file
exists, whether the required tables are present, and the current schema
version and applied-migration count. It never runs migrations and never
writes to the database. If the database file does not exist, it reports
an unhealthy result without creating one.

## Errors and sanitization

`MigrationError` may include the underlying DuckDB exception text, since
migration SQL is authored in this repository and never contains
credentials. This is unlike the provider connectors
(`market_intelligence/data_connectors/`), whose errors are always built
from sanitized components (status codes, exception type names) because
those requests do carry credentials. The `ingestion_runs.error_category`
column is intended to hold a similarly sanitized category, never a raw
exception message, once ingestion code that writes to it is added.
